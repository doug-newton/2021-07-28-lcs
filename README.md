# Longest Common Subsequence

LCS implementation in Typescript with tests in Mocha and Chai.

Inspired by [Lugriz](https://github.com/Lugriz/typescript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sets/longest-common-subsequence).

I kept his 7 test cases and used this as an exercise in test-driven development.
