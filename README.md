# Longest Common Subsequence

Why Longest Common Subsequence? I want to make my own diff utility.

Inspired by [Lugriz](https://github.com/Lugriz/typescript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sets/longest-common-subsequence).

Initially, his solution was copied straight into Typescript, along with his tests, to get an idea of how the solution worked.

I kept his 7 test cases, and then stripped down the algorithm to use this as a learning exercise for testing.

Using the matrix and backtracking steps as an assertion failure message helped a lot to find the flaws in my logic.

`master` branch only has the final solution, while `2021-07-28-lcs` is where I struggled to get it to work.
